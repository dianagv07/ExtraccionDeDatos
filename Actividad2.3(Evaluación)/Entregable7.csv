― Nicolas Chamfort
""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

herzlichen Dank für Ihr Interesse an unserem Unternehmen THE FLAG Zürich. Damit Sie sich auch in Zeiten von Corona sicher und wohl während Ihres Aufenthalts bei uns fühlen, möchten wir Ihnen im Folgenden einige Hinweise geben.
Wir möchten Sie darauf aufmerksam machen, dass aufgrund der aktuellen Coronapandemie in unserem Hotel eine strenge Maskenpflicht gilt. Bitte Tragen Sie eine Maske, sobald Sie Ihr Hotelzimmer verlassen und sich in öffentlichen Bereichen (Lobby, Flur, Aufzug, Tiefgarage etc.) aufhalten. Die Maske muss immer die Nase und den Mund bedecken.

Darüber hinaus möchten wir Sie darauf hinweisen, dass sich stets nur die bei der Buchung angegebene Anzahl an Personen in den Hotelzimmern aufhalten darf. Der Aufenthalt von weiteren Personen, Besuch oder Ähnlichem ist nicht gestattet. Wir behalten uns vor, unser Hausrecht bei Zuwiderhandlung (notfalls polizeilich) geltend zu machen. Feiern, Partys oder ähnliche Ansammlungen in den Hotelzimmern sind strengstens verboten.

Bei Check-In benötigen wir eine Garantie über die Summe Ihres Aufenthaltes sowie CHF 200.00 für mögliche Extras als Sicherheitskaution. Diese kann bei Anreise in Form von Bargeld, EC- oder Kreditkarte hinterlegt werden. Eine Rückerstattung erfolgt unmittelbar nach Ihrer Abreise. Das Hotel kann zudem eine Kopie Ihres Ausweises anfertigen.

Das Rauchen ist in all unseren Hotelzimmern sowie in den öffentlichen Bereichen von THE FLAG Zürich strengstens untersagt. THE FLAG ist ein reines Nichtraucherhotel. Bei Verstoß gegen das Rauchverbot behalten wir uns vor, die Reinigungskosten (bis zu CHF 500.00) in Rechnung zu stellen bzw. mit der Sicherheitskaution zu verrechnen.

herzlichen Dank für Ihr Interesse an unserem Unternehmen THE FLAG Zürich. Damit Sie sich auch in Zeiten von Corona sicher und wohl während Ihres Aufenthalts bei uns fühlen, möchten wir Ihnen im Folgenden einige Hinweise geben.
Wir möchten Sie darauf aufmerksam machen, dass aufgrund der aktuellen Coronapandemie in unserem Hotel eine strenge Maskenpflicht gilt. Bitte Tragen Sie eine Maske, sobald Sie Ihr Hotelzimmer verlassen und sich in öffentlichen Bereichen (Lobby, Flur, Aufzug, Tiefgarage etc.) aufhalten. Die Maske muss immer die Nase und den Mund bedecken.

Darüber hinaus möchten wir Sie darauf hinweisen, dass sich stets nur die bei der Buchung angegebene Anzahl an Personen in den Hotelzimmern aufhalten darf. Der Aufenthalt von weiteren Personen, Besuch oder Ähnlichem ist nicht gestattet. Wir behalten uns vor, unser Hausrecht bei Zuwiderhandlung (notfalls polizeilich) geltend zu machen. Feiern, Partys oder ähnliche Ansammlungen in den Hotelzimmern sind strengstens verboten. 

Sicherheitskaution:
Bei Check-In benötigen wir eine Garantie über die Summe Ihres Aufenthaltes sowie CHF 200.00 für mögliche Extras als Sicherheitskaution. Diese kann bei Anreise in Form von Bargeld, EC- oder Kreditkarte hinterlegt werden. Eine Rückerstattung erfolgt unmittelbar nach Ihrer Abreise. Das Hotel kann zudem eine Kopie Ihres Ausweises anfertigen.

Nichtraucherhotel:
Das Rauchen ist in all unseren Hotelzimmern sowie in den öffentlichen Bereichen von THE FLAG Zürich strengstens untersagt. THE FLAG ist ein reines Nichtraucherhotel. Bei Verstoß gegen das Rauchverbot behalten wir uns vor, die Reinigungskosten (bis zu CHF 500.00) in Rechnung zu stellen bzw. mit der Sicherheitskaution zu verrechnen. Das Rauchen ist nur auf Balkonen und Terrassen erlaubt.

Sachbeschädigung und Haftung:
Hotel- und Übernachtungsgäste haften für Schäden oder übermäßige Verschmutzung, welche sie am Eigentum von THE FLAG verursachen. Schadensersatzzahlungen werden mit der Sicherheitskaution verrechnet bzw. gesondert in Rechnung gestellt. 

Nachtruhe:
Zwischen 22.00 und 07.00 Uhr bitten wir Sie, die Nachtruhe zu respektieren und andere Gäste nicht zu stören. Personen, die gegen die Hausruhe verstoßen, kann ein weiterer Aufenthalt im THE FLAG Zürich verweigert werden. Ebenfalls kann ein Hausverbot ausgesprochen werden.


Zuwiderhandlungen gegen die vorgenannten Regeln werden mit bis zu CHF 500.00 geahndet.

Vielen Dank für die Beachtung der Regeln. Sollten Sie Fragen zu Ihrem Aufenthalt haben, stehen wir Ihnen jederzeit gerne zur Verfügung.

herzlichen Dank für Ihr Interesse an unserem Unternehmen THE FLAG Zürich. Damit Sie sich auch in Zeiten von Corona sicher und wohl während Ihres Aufenthalts bei uns fühlen, möchten wir Ihnen im Folgenden einige Hinweise geben.
Wir möchten Sie darauf aufmerksam machen, dass aufgrund der aktuellen Coronapandemie in unserem Hotel eine strenge Maskenpflicht gilt. Bitte Tragen Sie eine Maske, sobald Sie Ihr Hotelzimmer verlassen und sich in öffentlichen Bereichen (Lobby, Flur, Aufzug, Tiefgarage etc.) aufhalten. Die Maske muss immer die Nase und den Mund bedecken.

Darüber hinaus möchten wir Sie darauf hinweisen, dass sich stets nur die bei der Buchung angegebene Anzahl an Personen in den Hotelzimmern aufhalten darf. Der Aufenthalt von weiteren Personen, Besuch oder Ähnlichem ist nicht gestattet. Wir behalten uns vor, unser Hausrecht bei Zuwiderhandlung (notfalls polizeilich) geltend zu machen. Feiern, Partys oder ähnliche Ansammlungen in den Hotelzimmern sind strengstens verboten. 

Sicherheitskaution:
Bei Check-In benötigen wir eine Garantie über die Summe Ihres Aufenthaltes sowie CHF 200.00 für mögliche Extras als Sicherheitskaution. Diese kann bei Anreise in Form von Bargeld, EC- oder Kreditkarte hinterlegt werden. Eine Rückerstattung erfolgt unmittelbar nach Ihrer Abreise. Das Hotel kann zudem eine Kopie Ihres Ausweises anfertigen.

Nichtraucherhotel:
Das Rauchen ist in all unseren Hotelzimmern sowie in den öffentlichen Bereichen von THE FLAG Zürich strengstens untersagt. THE FLAG ist ein reines Nichtraucherhotel. Bei Verstoß gegen das Rauchverbot behalten wir uns vor, die Reinigungskosten (bis zu CHF 500.00) in Rechnung zu stellen bzw. mit der Sicherheitskaution zu verrechnen. Das Rauchen ist nur auf Balkonen und Terrassen erlaubt.

Sachbeschädigung und Haftung:
Hotel- und Übernachtungsgäste haften für Schäden oder übermäßige Verschmutzung, welche sie am Eigentum von THE FLAG verursachen. Schadensersatzzahlungen werden mit der Sicherheitskaution verrechnet bzw. gesondert in Rechnung gestellt. 

Nachtruhe:
Zwischen 22.00 und 07.00 Uhr bitten wir Sie, die Nachtruhe zu respektieren und andere Gäste nicht zu stören. Personen, die gegen die Hausruhe verstoßen, kann ein weiterer Aufenthalt im THE FLAG Zürich verweigert werden. Ebenfalls kann ein Hausverbot ausgesprochen werden.
